#My conditional program will run the user through a day of school life. It will give the users options in the beginning they will be given three options to choose which will determine when they arrive at school(they won't know the value of the options until chosen). After that the user will be able to decide her/his day with different options given to them(some of whose value they will and some which they won’t). The different options may be items that the user can eat for lunch and how they can answer the teacher in class, stuff like that. Depending on their grade, which will be inputted by the user, the teachers will be determined. All of these executions will be carried out using raw_input,relational operators and many functions probably. Python commands like import math and import random will come into play during math class. “”” “”” and     “ ”.format will automatically come into play during programming.
